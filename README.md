## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Procedure

### 1. CATIA Modeling
- Created boom (4.4m length) and arm (2.2m length) models based on actual excavator specifications
- Assembled components into complete structure (Parts.CATProduct)

### 2. COMSOL Import & Preprocessing
- Imported CATIA assembly model into COMSOL
- Applied time-dependent boundary conditions using MATLAB/Simulink simulation data (joint angles/torques)

### 3. Boundary Conditions & Loading
- Fixed constraint applied at bucket end
- Time-varying joint torque/angle data mapped as rotational loads
- Maximum operational load conditions considered

### 4. Finite Element (FEM) Analysis
- 2nd order tetrahedral elements with AutoMesh (Level 6)
- Time-dependent study (3.5s-5.8s with 0.1s intervals)
- Von Mises Stress calculation at joint areas for each time step

### 5. Results Visualization
- Tabulated maximum stress values at Joint 1 & 2 over time
- 3D visualization of stress distribution and critical locations

## üîé Key Findings & Conclusions

- **Stress Concentration at Joints:** Maximum Von Mises Stress observed at boom-arm connection points
- **Torque-Stress Correlation:** Stress patterns closely follow torque variations from MATLAB/Simulink
- **Moment Arm Effect:** 24.5% higher stress at obtuse angles (150¬∞) vs right angles (90¬∞)
- **Safety Factor Evaluation:** Maximum stress of 53.15 MPa at joints meets 1.98 safety factor requirement
