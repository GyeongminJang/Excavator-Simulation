# Excavator 2-Link Manipulator Simulation

This project simplifies the boom and arm of a real Doosan DX140W-5 excavator into a 2-link manipulator, and performs dynamic analysis, control, and structural evaluation using MATLAB and Simulink.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

- **Excavator Modeling:** Simplified as a 2-link manipulator based on actual excavator specifications
- **Kinematics/Dynamics Analysis:** Forward/inverse kinematics, Lagrangian-based dynamic modeling
- **Controller Design:** PD controller for accurate trajectory tracking
- **Simulation:** Path graphs in MATLAB, time-series output of joint position/velocity/acceleration/torque in Simulink
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Real-time movement of boom and arm via Plot_Excavator.m
- **Performance Analysis:** Comparison graphs of vibration and trajectory tracking before and after PD control
- **Structural Analysis Integration:** Joint torque/angle data from Simulink can be used for further structural analysis (COMSOL)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Run `Excavator_Settings.m` in MATLAB to set up environment and variables
2. Open and run `Excavator_Control.slx` in Simulink (or use `open('Excavator_Control.slx')` in MATLAB)
3. Run `Excavator_Simulation.m` to perform the full simulation and view performance analysis graphs
4. During simulation, `Plot_Excavator.m` is automatically called to display real-time plots
